			 	<p>Gabriel Bohm Santos (Pelotas, April 2, 1996), 
				better known by the nickname Kami or KamiKat, 
				is a professional League of Legends player 
				Brazilian who plays for paiN Gaming team
				since 2011 in the middle position, being 
				considered by many to be the best Brazilian player. </p> 

		 		<p> As he was the player for the longest time in the 
		 		team, he won two editions of the Brazilian League of Legends 
		 		Championship - 2013 and a second stage of 2015.
		 	
		 		

		 		<p>A pro-player needs to breathe 100% LoL 
		 		and needs to dedicate their time to the
		 		maximum. I discovered that I have a
		 		passion for aviation, that I have the dream
		 		 of becoming an airplane pilot, so I started
		 		 studying and I want to follow that. 
		 		I don't know when, but I want to follow
		 		 this as a profession.</p>
